# Console Kit

Console Kit is an SDK for building autonomous DeFi agents while providing programmatic access to Console's core DeFi utilities. The SDK enables developers to create sophisticated agents that can manage user funds and execute complex strategies, all secured by Console's policy engine and execution infrastructure. Essential DeFi primitives like optimal swap routing, MEV-protected execution, and cross-chain liquidity management are exposed as modular functions, enabling flexible integration paths from simple utility use to full autonomous agents.

The SDK abstracts away the underlying complexity of sub-accounts, policy management, and transaction execution, allowing developers to focus on building powerful autonomous strategies while inheriting Console's security features.
