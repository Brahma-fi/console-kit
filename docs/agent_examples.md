## Examples & Use-Cases

Here's what you can build with Console Kit:

### Agentic Accounts

**What:** Creates an autonomous agent capable of managing user funds and executing actions based on pre-defined strategies and market conditions, all secured by policy guards. The agent can interact with various DeFi protocols, manage positions, and optimize yields while operating within strict security parameters.

**Why:** Enables true hands-off automation of complex DeFi strategies while maintaining security through policy-driven controls, allowing users to benefit from autonomous management without compromising on safety.

**How:**

- Policy Guards define strict boundaries for agent actions (transaction limits, approved protocols, maximum position sizes)
- The agent monitors market conditions, protocol states, and on-chain opportunities
- Autonomous decision-making occurs within policy constraints
- Execution happens through secure executors with specific permissions
- All actions are logged and can be monitored through a dashboard

### Abstracted Lending Account

**What:** Creates an intelligent lending optimizer that dynamically manages positions across multiple lending protocols through a unified interface, incorporating real-time market analysis and risk assessment capabilities.

**Why:** Maximizes lending efficiency and returns while minimizing risks through automated market analysis and position management, enabling users to capitalize on the best opportunities across the entire DeFi lending landscape.

**How:**

- Real-time rate indexing across all major lending protocols
- Dynamic risk scoring based on protocol TVL, utilization rates, and historical stability
- Automated position rebalancing with gas-optimized execution
- Custom risk parameters and yield thresholds per asset
- Integrated liquidation protection through multi-protocol position monitoring

### Rekt SAFU Account

**What:** Establishes an advanced security system that provides proactive protection against protocol exploits and market manipulation events, incorporating multiple layers of defensive mechanisms and automated response protocols.

**Why:** Creates a robust defense against the increasing sophistication of DeFi attacks, ensuring asset safety through automated threat detection and rapid response capabilities.

**How:**

- Multi-source threat detection integrating FORTA, Hypernative, and custom monitoring systems
- Tiered response protocols based on threat severity and confidence levels
- Advanced slippage management with MEV-aware execution
- Automated circuit breakers for suspicious activity
- Cross-chain emergency withdrawal coordination with fallback options

### Leverage Management Account

**What:** Deploys an intelligent position manager that actively maintains optimal leverage across multiple protocols while implementing sophisticated risk management strategies and automated defense mechanisms.

**Why:** Protects leveraged positions against market volatility while maximizing capital efficiency through dynamic position management and automated risk mitigation.

**How:**

- Real-time health factor monitoring with predictive analytics
- Dynamic collateral management across multiple protocols
- Automated position scaling based on market conditions
- Custom risk parameters with gradual position adjustment logic

### Account Recovery System

**What:** Implements a sophisticated recovery framework with multi-stage activation protocols and configurable security measures to ensure reliable fund recovery while preventing unauthorized access.

**Why:** Provides a robust safety net against various access loss scenarios while maintaining high security standards and preventing potential exploitation of the recovery mechanism.

**How:**

- Multi-factor inactivity verification system
- Graduated recovery stages with increasing security checks
- Configurable timeframes and recovery thresholds
- Multiple recovery address options with priority ordering
- Automated verification of recovery address health before transfers
